### About Me
I am a coder , and an Embedded Software Developer. I love desing new thing on Embedded System. I work with Embedded protocol including Internet Protocol lile MQTT, HTTP, TCP, Peripheral Protocol like UART, I2C, SPI, Timer etc. I am passionate about technologies and love coding and managing teams. In my spare time, I like to learn about the advance C Coding Sytle, Complex Problem of Pointer and try to solve the more difficult code of C. I always follow and try to improve my coding systel and adopt new method of coding. I always look best of the coding.

Currently I am working on own desing of STM32 MCU Driver, which will help to use most of the Peripheral Protocol very easy.
